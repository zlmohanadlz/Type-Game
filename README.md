## Overview

**Type Game** is a simple, fun, and interactive typing game designed to improve typing speed, accuracy, and focus. Players are challenged to type random words under time constraints, with adjustable difficulty levels and additional first-attempt buffs.

The project is **fully responsive** and works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 🕹 Gameplay

1. Select the difficulty level (Easy, Normal, Hard).
2. Click the **Start** button to begin the game.
3. Type the words displayed as fast as possible before the timer runs out.
4. The first attempt has a small **time buff (+3 seconds)** for extra advantage.
5. If the word is typed correctly, you move to the next word.
6. The game ends when a word is typed incorrectly or all words are completed.
7. Your **score** is recorded, and high scores are saved in your browser using `localStorage`.
8. At the end of the game, a **Restart** button appears to replay immediately.
